With the rise of craft distilleries and experimental spirit brands, there is a shift towards premium, small-batch flavored spirits. Additionally, millennials and Gen Z are fueling the market with their preference for new, exciting flavor combinations and healthier alternatives like low-sugar or organic ingredients.
